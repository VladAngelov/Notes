# Active Directory

A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use. 
Active Directory uses a structured data store as the basis for a logical, hierarchical organization of directory information.
A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators.
* For example:
    * AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access this information.

## Directory data store
The Active Directory directory service uses a data store for all directory information. This data store is often referred to as the directory.
The directory contains information about objects such as users, groups, computers, domains, organizational units, and security policies.
This information can be published for use by users and administrators.
